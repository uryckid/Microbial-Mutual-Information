# Microbial-Mutual-Information
This record includes software and data used to compute shared information between streamwater microbial taxa and hydrologic metrics for the article:  
URycki, D. R., Bassiouni, M., Good, S. P., Crump, B. C., &amp; Li, B. (2022). The streamwater microbiome encodes hydrologic data across scales.Â Science of The Total Environment, 157911. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.157911

To run this analysis:
1. Download all files and folders into a primary parent directory.
2. Load necessary Python libraries using the file 'requirements.txt' -OR- 
	create a virtual environment with the file 'genohydro_mi.yml.' 
3. First run the script '01_compute_microbial_MI.py'
4. After the first script has completed, run the second script '02_analyze_microbial_MI.py'


Notes: 
a. These scripts were developed on Windows OS, but might run on Linux-like systems.
b. The second script depends on output files from the first script.
c. The script 'genohydro.py' contains helper functions necessary for the first script to run.
